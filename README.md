# Front End Starter Repository

This is the basic React development configuration created by
[Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app).

To use it you just need to run `npm install` to create your local repository.
After that all the development capabilities of *Create-React-App* will be available to you. See the `ReactREADME.md` file for details.
